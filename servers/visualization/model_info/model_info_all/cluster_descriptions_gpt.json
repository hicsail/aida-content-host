    "3": "Cluster 3 includes topics: GenAI Integration In Education, GenAI Model Usage Risks, Academic Integrity and GenAI. Cluster 3 primarily revolves around the themes of Generative AI (GenAI) and its integration, usage, and ethical implications within the education sector. GenAI is a type of artificial intelligence that generates content such as images, text, and language models, which can be either beneficial or harmful depending on the context of its usage.\n\nOne key theme in this cluster is the integration of GenAI in education. This topic focuses on how GenAI tools are used by students and teachers in the educational sector. The keywords suggest that these tools are utilized in courses and assignments, presenting a significant impact on teaching and learning processes. However, the integration of GenAI in education also necessitates the establishment of policies to ensure its appropriate and ethical use.\n\nAnother central theme is the risks associated with the usage of GenAI models. These risks stem from the ability of GenAI to generate content such as images, text, and language models. The potential for misuse of these generative models poses a significant concern, particularly in the context of data integrity and the generation of misleading or false information.\n\nThe final theme is academic integrity in the context of GenAI. This topic delves into the ethical implications of using GenAI in an academic setting. Keywords such as 'appeal', 'dean', 'designee', 'provost', 'violation', 'integrity', 'penalty', and 'instructor' suggest the involvement of high-level academic authorities in managing and resolving cases of academic misconduct involving GenAI. This theme underscores the importance of maintaining academic integrity amidst the rise of advanced AI technologies.\n\nThe interconnectedness of these themes lies in the usage of GenAI. While it can serve as a powerful tool in education, it also brings about certain risks and ethical considerations. Therefore, the integration of GenAI in education not only demands an understanding of its potential benefits and risks but also a robust framework to ensure academic integrity."
